# Installing from a tar archive

For putting the integration onto a device that cannot reach HACS — an appliance
on a closed network, or a first install before HACS is configured.

## Build the archive

On a machine with the repository checked out:

```bash
./scripts/build_release_archive.sh
```

```
Built dist/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz
  version : 0.2.0
  commit  : 9d5c623
  files   : 25
  size    : 660K
  sha256  : 58e6925b24aebd0e077e9954d477afa8d4fba045fab72a8681e52050987f2776
```

The file list comes from `git ls-files`, so tests, previews, dev tooling and
`__pycache__` cannot end up in it. The script refuses to build if
`custom_components/solar_cube/` has uncommitted or untracked files, because
either would mean the archive does not match the commit it claims to be.

The archive contains exactly `custom_components/solar_cube/`, so it extracts
directly into a Home Assistant configuration directory.

## Copy it to the device

```bash
scp dist/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz \
    dist/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz.sha256 \
    sc-admin@solarcube:/tmp/
```

Verify the transfer before installing:

```bash
ssh sc-admin@solarcube 'cd /tmp && sha256sum -c solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz.sha256'
# solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz: OK
```

## Install

Pick the case that matches how Home Assistant runs on the device.

### A. Home Assistant in a container, config on a host path

The usual appliance layout. Find the host path backing `/config`:

```bash
docker inspect homeassistant \
  --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{.Source}} -> {{.Destination}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
# /opt/homeassistant/config -> /config
```

Then extract into it:

```bash
CONFIG=/opt/homeassistant/config
sudo tar -xzf /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz -C "$CONFIG"
sudo ls -l "$CONFIG/custom_components/solar_cube/manifest.json"
```

### B. Home Assistant in a container, config in a named volume

No host path to write to, so copy through the container:

```bash
docker cp /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz homeassistant:/tmp/
docker exec homeassistant tar -xzf /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz -C /config
docker exec homeassistant rm /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz
```

Under Docker-in-Docker, run these inside the outer container first:

```bash
docker cp /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz docker-client:/tmp/
docker exec docker-client docker cp /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz homeassistant:/tmp/
docker exec docker-client docker exec homeassistant \
  tar -xzf /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz -C /config
```

### C. Home Assistant OS / Supervised

Use the Samba or SSH add-on and extract into `/config`:

```bash
tar -xzf /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.0.tar.gz -C /config
```

## Restart and add the integration

```bash
docker restart homeassistant        # or: ha core restart
```

Then in the web UI:

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Solar Cube**
2. Fill in the InfluxDB URL, token, organization and bucket names.
3. Leave **Import dashboards** and **Automatically download the required
   dashboard cards** enabled unless you intend to manage those yourself.
4. When Home Assistant asks to restart (Settings → Repairs), accept — some
   Lovelace pieces only settle after one.
5. Hard-refresh the browser afterwards (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R) so the new
   frontend resources load.

## Upgrading an existing install

Extracting over the top is enough — the archive replaces every shipped file:

```bash
sudo tar -xzf /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.1.tar.gz -C "$CONFIG"
docker restart homeassistant
```

Your configuration is untouched: it lives in the config entry, not in these
files. If a file was removed between versions it will linger, so for a clean
upgrade delete the directory first — this discards nothing you configured:

```bash
sudo rm -rf "$CONFIG/custom_components/solar_cube"
sudo tar -xzf /tmp/solar_cube-0.2.1.tar.gz -C "$CONFIG"
```

## Checking it loaded

```bash
docker logs homeassistant 2>&1 | grep -i solar_cube | tail -20
```

A healthy start shows the setup running and, if the LCD is enabled, a line like:

```
Solar Cube S1 LCD display activated (bridge=http://solar_lcd_bridge:8765, lang=pl, currency=PLN)
```

If the integration does not appear in the Add Integration list:

- confirm `manifest.json` sits at
  `<config>/custom_components/solar_cube/manifest.json` — one directory too deep
  is the usual cause;
- confirm Home Assistant restarted after the files were placed;
- check the log for `custom integration` warnings, which are expected and
  harmless, versus an ImportError, which is not.

## What the archive does not contain

The Solar Cube PRO S1 LCD panel is driven by a separate service, the **Solar
LCD Bridge**, distributed as a Docker image rather than in this archive. It is
only needed if you enable the LCD display option. See that project's README:
