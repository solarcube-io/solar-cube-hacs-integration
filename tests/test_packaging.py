hacs.json advertises a minimum Home Assistant core, and requirements-test.txt

nothing about the version users are told to run -- which is how three CI
failures reached a pull request: the suite was pinned to 2025.12.0 while the
integration was deployed on 2026.1.3, and the pinned core had a dependency
break the supported one does not.
